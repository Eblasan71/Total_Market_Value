# ANOVA Analysis Project ‚öôÔ∏è
The goal of this project is to explore how different categorical factors impact the price of cars. Using ANOVA (Analysis of Variance), we examine various features like brand, engine type, and horsepower to understand their influence on vehicle pricing. The analysis provides insights into which factors are statistically significant, and highlights potential areas for further research, such as predictive modeling or market segmentation strategies.

# Methodology üêç
For this project, I used a dataset containing various features of cars, including brand, fuel system, drive wheels, engine type, and horsepower. The data was analyzed in Python, utilizing libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, statsmodels for the ANOVA test, and Seaborn/Matplotlib for data visualization.

ANOVA was employed to determine if differences between groups (e.g., different car brands or engine types) have a significant impact on the target variable (price). The results include F-statistics and p-values that help identify which features contribute most to variations in price.

# Key Insights:

Significant Factors: Features like brand, horsepower, and engine type showed significant impacts on car prices.
Non-Significant Factors: Some variables, like drive wheels, did not have a meaningful effect on price.
This analysis provides the foundation for future work in predictive modeling or segmentation, where these significant factors can be used to build more accurate price prediction models.
